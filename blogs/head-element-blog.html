    <h1>What's in the Head of a HTML File?</h1>
    <div class="container container-center">
        <p>
            In this blog, we are going to go through the head element which is inside the HTML element. The head element has information that isn't displayed on the website you are designing, this information is the metadata, title of the web page, link to the webpage styling file, link to web page favicon.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Before diving deep into all the topics mentioned above, let's first understand what HTML is.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>What is HTML?</strong></div>
        <p>
            HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Mark-up Language, HTML is used to describe the structure of your web page to the browser by telling the browser where the on the webpage the heading is, the paragraph is, on which text the weights should be added and so on.

            Any HTML file has many elements which together build the structure of a webpage, elements have an opening tag, closing tag and content to be displayed on the webpage. for example, a piece of text can be defined as a heading, paragraph or list of items by using different HTML elements.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Head Element</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/head-image.PNG"/>
        <p>
            The head element contains information about the web page which includes keywords, description about the page which helps in finding the webpage during a search, CSS file to give style i.e. adding colour, margin, border and so on to our webpage, metacharacters, the title of the webpage. The information contained within the head element is not displayed on the webpage.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color:darkblue;">
            Note: Even though this information is not displayed on the webpage, but still, this information plays a key role in finding the webpage and bringing it on the list of your search results.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s have a look at everything that is there in the head of HTML</p>

        <div style="padding-bottom: 1rem;"></div>
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Meta Element - What is meta data</strong> </div>
        <p>Metadata is information(data) about a webpage, for example, metadata of a webpage includes information(data) like the author of the webpage, description of the webpage, the character set used for the webpage, keywords to describe the webpage. and viewport settings. Meta tag uses various attributes to set the different aspects mentioned above.</p>
    
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Character Encoding of documents</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/charset.PNG"/>
        <p>
            UTF is an acronym for Unicode Transformation format, this can be used to represent any Unicode character. (Unicode is a character encoding that assigns a code to every symbol and character in every language.) By using this attribute your web page will be able to display any human language.</p>
        
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Adding Author</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/author.PNG" width="60" height="70"  />
        <p>The attribute name specifies the type of metadata, and content is used to specify the actual metadata.
            Mentioning the author of the webpage can be beneficial as one can know who built the webpage and by using some extraction technique when can get the information of the author as well.</p>
    
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Adding Description</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/description.PNG" />
        <p>Using description type data and adding keywords that describe your web to the content attribute can help in finding your page in the search results. The search engine also uses metadata to find a web page, hence using this will help in making your page come higher in the order of search results.
        </p>
    
        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Viewport settings</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/viewport.PNG" height="70" />
        <p>Viewport means the user’s visible area of a webpage, it varies according to the device, example visible area on a computer screen is bigger than a mobile screen. This tag is used to tell the browser how to render a page on a mobile device. width=device-width tells the web page to take the width of the device initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level, when the page is loaded by the browser</p>

        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Title</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/title.PNG" />
        <p>The title elements are used to specify the title of the webpage, this title is not visible on the webpage, but comes beside the icon of the webpage</p>

        <div class="sub-heading"><strong>Adding CSS to HTML</strong> </div>
        <img class="head-img" src="/images/css.PNG" />
        <p>Rel is used to specify that the document is a style sheet and href is used to specifying the path of the style sheet file.</p>
        <p>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets is used to make the webpage look beautiful by adding colours and styling to different elements.This styling file should be added in the head of the HTML itself, this can be done by using a link element. The link element takes two attributes namely rel and href.</p>
