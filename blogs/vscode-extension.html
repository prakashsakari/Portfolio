    <h1>VS Code Extension for Web Development</h1>
    <div class="container container-center">
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a powerful code editor made by Microsoft, with its amazing support for all programming languages, it has become the favourite of programmers, especially in the web development community it has gained more acknowledgement because of its inbuilt support for JavaScript, TypeScript nad Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many extensions for all programming languages in VS code, I am going to put the extension which you can use on a daily basis for web development.

        <a class="link" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer" target="_blank"><strong>Bracket Pair Colorizer</strong></a>
        <p>
            Bracket Pair Colorizer allows matching brackets to be identified with the same colours, by default (), [] and {} are matched with the same colour.When brackets are nested together it becomes visually difficult to identify the opening and the closing brackets. Bracket Pair Colorizer becomes useful at such times where it adds colours to bracket pairs so even if there is a nested set of brackets, it's easy to visually identify the pair of brackets.

            Every programmer desires to have a beautiful looking code but most of them are not able to format it beautifully.Prettier code formatted takes care of that by formatting the code in its own way, like removing unnecessary spaces between the lines, taking into account word wrap and other such factors.
